This was my first web app built using WEB2py library.It consists of in-built geo-locator to look for restaurants near you.
Javascript effects were added using jquery library.
It has authentication mechanism for creating and modifying user and restaurant accounts.
Rating system is provided to search restaurants by their rating.
ajax search feature was used to look for restaurants with a particular name or an area-wise lookup.
